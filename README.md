Project Title: Brain Tumor Segmentation Using Computer Vision

Overview:
Brain tumor segmentation plays a vital role in medical diagnostics by enabling early detection and treatment planning. This project harnesses computer vision techniques to automatically segment brain tumors from MRI scans, enhancing diagnostic precision and operational efficiency.

Technologies Used: Programming Language: Python Libraries: OpenCV, NumP Framework:Streamli Techniques: Image preprocessing, thresholding, contour detection, deep learning-based segmentation (optional or advanced)

Project Workflow:

1. Image Acquisition: Input MRI scan images in standard formats (e.g., JPG, PNG, or DICOM).
2. Preprocessing: Grayscale conversion, noise reduction, normalization, and histogram equalization.
3. Segmentation Techniques:

   Basic: Thresholding, morphological operations, and contour analysis.
   Advanced (optional): U-Net or other convolutional neural networks for deep learning segmentation.
4. Visualization & Deployment:

  Interactive interface via Streamlit for image upload, segmentation output, and comparison views.
  Real-time processing and feedback for medical professionals.

Key Skills Gained:Python Programming: Efficient scripting for medical image analysis.
Computer Vision: Applying segmentation methods to real-world healthcare imaging data.
